Dear Senator (NAME),
My name is (insert name). I am an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) in (state/jurisdiction). I am writing to request your
support for (bill #). This legislation will assist our jurisdiction in meeting the new national standards for APRNs outlined in the
Consensus Model for APRN Regulation (which can be accessed by visiting www.ncsbn.org/aprn.htm).
